> Systems like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are the end result of years and years of effort spent slowly abstracting server resources from being "a single physical machine your app is running on" to "a distributed pool of generic resources any app can run on." 

- What do you think the next level of server abstraction will look like in 10 years? 

It is hard to say in 10 years because now cloud computing itself is an emerging technology, and for many years, it provides benefits to companies and organizations. The world is moving into an age of serverless architecture very quickly. So, there are many technologies related to clouds such as cloud shared infrastructure, containerization, and serverless architecture. These technologies are getting modified day by day and providing several benefits.

There are few technologies, which can be kept in mind either the upgraded version of the cloud or the technologies, like *Edge Computing*, *Internet of Things (IoT)*, *Distributed Ledger*, and *Cryptocurrency*.

Cloud computing itself is a technology that will sustain for years. This is one of a basic technologies and we can use it to play the basic part in the companies. The above-mentioned technologies will definitely help in the future of cloud computing and make it brighter.

- How will web apps be deployed and managed a decade from now? Will container management systems such as Kubernetes still be used, or will there be another layer of abstraction used?

I remember 10 years ago when we were deploying applications locally and hosting them using IIS or NGINX. It was hard for large-scale projects to deploy. After that, container management systems like Docker and K8s bring their ideas to life by conquering the complexity of app development. And now, we are using both ways in many companies around the world.

All I'm saying is that the providers are moving forward and modifying their products every day. For example, Kubernetes is using Docker as a container runtime, and after v1.22, it will be changed to other compliant container runtimes, like containerd or CRI-O.

So, deploying a web app a decade from now would be easier for everyone, and I suppose we will using container management systems such as Kubernetes.
